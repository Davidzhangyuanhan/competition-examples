# How to participate

You should submit an untrained model in a python file `model.py` which contains
your `class Model`, which will be imported, trained, and tested on Codalab.

See the "Seed" page for the outline of a `Model` class, with the expected
function names.

See the "Timeline" page for additional information about the phases of this
competition

### Caveat
If you are going to use one of the solutions listed in the "Files" section
to submit a baseline, be sure to unzip the file you download, re-zip the
`model.py` file by itself so you are submitting `model.py.zip` instead.
This is a known bug, and fixes are being considered.
